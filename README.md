This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This app uses Next JS.

# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app```

You will also need the following dependencies:

React-hot-toast for sick loading bars and miscellaneous notifications:

# or
yarn add react-hot-toast```

Material UI:
```npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled```

Prisma:
```npm install prisma --save-dev```

## Game Time
